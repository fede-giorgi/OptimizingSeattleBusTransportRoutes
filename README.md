# Math 381 Group Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Math 381 Group Project. The goal of this project is to optimize Seattle's bus transport routes using Minimum Spanning Graphs.

### Project Aim
Urban congestion presents economic, environmental, and social challenges. This project leverages graph theory to optimize Seattle's public transit system by designing an efficient bus network. The approach involves modeling the city's road infrastructure as a weighted graph, constructing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to minimize redundancy, and refining routes through optimization techniques. The model ensures better transit coverage, strategic bus stop placement, and improved accessibility while maintaining operational efficiency.
